title: About
---
 

I am a software developer with experience in C#/.NET, HTML, CSS, Blazor, Javascript, Swift and more.
I graduated from UCSB in 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering and have been working at Silvergate Bank since.
At Silvergate I have been focusing in on cloud infrastatructure with Kubernetes, Blazor UI development, and API design and integration.

I mainly work with Kubernetes, .NET, Azure, and various other technologies, but I also commit time to Swift based iOS personal projects.

When I am not coding, I love to go climbing, play hockey, and dabble in woodworking.
