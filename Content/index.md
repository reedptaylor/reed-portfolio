title: About
---
 

I am a software developer with experience in C#/.Net Core, HTML, CSS, Blazor, Javascript, Swift and more. I graduated from UCSB in 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering and have been working at Silvergate Bank since. At Silvergate I have been focusing in on Blazor UI development and API design and integration.

I mainly work with .Net Core, Azure, and various other technologies, but I also commit time to Swift based iOS personal projects.

When I am not coding, I love to go climbing, play hockey, and dabble in woodworking.
