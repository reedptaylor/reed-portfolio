# Welcome to my new website!

Hello, my name is Reed. I am a software engineering located in San Diego California. Currently, I work for Silvergate Bank and help them with their payments API and their Banking Portal (UI). I have had some fun projects done on the side such as my iOS apps Overdrive and Daiscover. As I continue to work on small projects for fun, I plan to post about them here.
